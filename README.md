# Blackjack
Developed a Blackjack game website using HTML, CSS, Python, and SQLite. Users can play the game while their scores are updated in real-time. The application features a global leaderboard that displays top players. Utilized Flask for the back end and SQLAlchemy for efficient database management, showcasing my web development and database skills.
